# BTS YouTube Visualized

An on-going interactive visualization project for BTS related YouTube videos and comments.

## Synopysis

While the global popularity of K-pop has been rising rapidly in the past few years, the boy-band group [BTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS) has undoubtedly sparked a new era of K-pop craze throughout the world.

Thanks to their robust and diverse fandom called the ARMY, BTS has become the fastest act to accumulate five US number-one singles since Michael Jackson.

A huge medium for their music and content is [YouTube](), where they have accumulated over 5.5 billion views! As a software developer with great interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP), I thought it would be fun to examine and explore what the fans are saying on the most popular BTS related YouTube videos!
